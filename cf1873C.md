(1st time C problem)

 This one took, about an hour of brain-rot thinking with a friend while giving the semester practical exam for Web Designing lab (Funny isn't it 🗿)

 What approach we encountered was....

 Dividing the grid in 4 parts,
 and for all i,jth indexe
 if i and j > n//2 (i.e. more than half length)
 then reduce them to factor range of 1-5

 furthur, the score line would be the minimum index from i,j 

and with this logic,
iterate through the nested arrays, searching for X, and simultaneously, adding the score that was made by that shot
