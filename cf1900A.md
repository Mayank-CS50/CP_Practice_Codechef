A. Cover in Water

A nightmare problem to be understood my one who hasn't played Minecraft
yes 😂

The problem asks for minimum new water buckets needed to fill all chambers with water, if :

1. if for any empty chamber i, if i+1 and i-1 is filled, then i will fill automatically, just how it happened in Minecraft
2. we can use that water to fill up futhur places

Hence we get to know 'experiences' never go in vain 😤

"Simple approach for this one : 

if : there exists any continous sequence of more than 3 chambers in continutation, then all chambers can be easily filled with water with 2 buckets.

else : the sum of all individual blocks/ chambers sum of buckets are required"
