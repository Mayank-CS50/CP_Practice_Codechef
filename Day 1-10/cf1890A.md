The problem relates to pattern where and array exists such that it's adjacent elements are always same : 
In simple words : Array = a, b, c, d
then for all elements, a+b=b+c=c+d=k
To check if an array can be formed with permutations in the array

Solution is pretty simple :
deducing the relation from expression, a+b=b+c=c+d, so a=c & b=d 
or alternate digits inn array arr[n]={a,b,a,b,a,b)

if n(distinct elements) in arr>2 : impossible
elif n(distinct elements) in arr==1 : always possible, since sum is always same
else:
 if |A| is even and frequency (elements a==b) : Possible 
 else :
 one element must be one more than the other,
 i.e. : freq(a)==(b)+1 : Yes, it's Possible

At the end, if all of it fails
Then, return Not Possible
