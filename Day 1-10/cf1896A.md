A. Jagged Swaps

Perfect example of :
Big problem statements doesn't always implies the biggest code is required for them to solve out

In this problem, initally reader thinks, that the problem is asking for a general sorting problem code but with some special conditions

which is, if b<a>c, then only a and c can be swapped

putting it in simple words, all the eventual peaks present in between can be sorted out 

THUS, all the peaks can be sorted by any required no. of processes, 
until the 1 is present on the very first place

Since 1 is the smallest number present on the permutation, it's not bigger than any number,
thus, for the possibility of being sorted, it has to be in the correct position only 
i.e. the 1st place (0th index)

problem boils down to
If index 0 == 1 :
sortable 
else
Not
