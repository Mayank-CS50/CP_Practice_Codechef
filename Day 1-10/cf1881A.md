A. Don't Try to Count

There exits two strings x and s, where s>x
To determine :  whether it's possible that after n operations, it's possible that s becomes substring of x, where after each operation, x+=x

Simple approach, keeping a safe upperbound of range of operations (2*len(s)),
and simultaneously appending previous version of x into itself and checking side by side with a counter

returning the counter when found, else return -1
