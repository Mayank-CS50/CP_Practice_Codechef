A. Line Trip

Question initally tries to twist us up, but 
The Approach was actually very simple

We had to notice the different testcases provided in them

from the testcases and a little bit observation, i thought, the maximum distance car has to run in a continous run has to be the minimum capacity of that car

Given us : is our starting position 0 and finish point x and petrol refill stations in middle at random locations
we just had to calculate the maximum distance that there can exist between
1. two continuous refill stations (absolute value of diff of 2 stations)
2. distance of 1st refill station from 0 (Starting point)
3. double the distance of last station and end point because car has to reach there and take a U Turn and come back to that point as well

0     1     2     5           7
