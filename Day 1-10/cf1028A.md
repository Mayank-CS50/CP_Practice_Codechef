A. Find Square

First things first
this is not thee best solution, mera intutional brute force hai,
when i'll learn constructive algorithm, i'll come bck and optimise it

Here's my approach,
Iterating throught each row, and column me individually checking and finding the first occurance of the 'B' black space, that is present as an odd number length side, in given matrix

And storing the first ocourance and seperately counting uski occurance in that 1st occurance line only, and in that line only

Later,
we now know the length of the black grid, and using basic maths,
agar side size is odd, to center se, length of side ka relation is 2n+1=length

equation reverse krke apply krdis

And solved !
