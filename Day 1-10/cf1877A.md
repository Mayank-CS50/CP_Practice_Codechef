Here's the concept, 

Efficiency in this question is : 'diff. b/w thier scores'

Considering if two teams compete, and with each goals, both of their scores either increment or decrement by one.

similarly for n teams, the sum of their effeciencies cancel out always (+1 for ones & -1 for other), thus SUM remains constant

what was the SUM originally ? Well, we always start with a 0 point

Thus, mathematically,

SUM=a1+a2+........+an
an=SUM-(a1+a2+...........an-1)
an=-(a1+a2+...........an-1)

Answer would be negative sum of all the n-1 team efficiencies
