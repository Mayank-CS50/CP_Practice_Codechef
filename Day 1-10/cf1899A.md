A. Game with Integers

Problem simply wants us to know,
that if each player can either add or subtract one from the current integer
Vanya starts the game

If after her chance, Vanya's integer is divisible by 3, she WINS
else, Vova wins

Simplest approach (little help from Deepseek)

Cases possible (n%3)=either [0,1,2]
1. if initial current Integer is multiple of 3, then after uski chance, either +1/-1, number surely won't be divisible by 3 (and vova bhi har possible chance try kar lega, to avoid her winning)
HENCE, VOVA HAMESHA WINS

2. else, agar n%2 is either 1 or 2
Dono possibility use karke, Vanya will win either ways (-1 for n%3=1) and  (+1 for n%3=2)
HENCE, VANYA ALWAYS WINS
