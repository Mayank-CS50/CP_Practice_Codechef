A. Halloumi Boxes

Approach was actually very simple

We had to notice the different testcases provided in them

I got a sudden click when i realised, arey 2 elements swap karke we can anyhow sort any type of array
This is also called Bubble sort, which brings us to the desicisive point

The output would be True either if the array is already sorted or K ki given value is atleast 2, usse jyada hogi bhi to apne ko usage nahi hoga, because k=2 me hi poora sorting possible hoga, and that is wot is required here
