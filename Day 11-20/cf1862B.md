B. Sequence Game

Tried A totally random Approach aka Observation for this one
Failed thrice, but got a successful submission at the end

This is one of those questions having multiple correct solutions

Given : Array A : [a,b,c,d]
if element x is bigger than or equal to it's previous element, then only it will be written down into an new array (IT SHOULD BE EVER INCREASING)

My Approach :
Taking 1st element as it is
And then checking for such elements <(less than) the previous element, then adding it to new array twice, since during the process, one of them will vanish, and other one will be taken into new array
else, simply adding the element in new array

DONE, solved
