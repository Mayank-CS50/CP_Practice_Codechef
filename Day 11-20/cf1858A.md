A. Buttons

Another ques. that took a bit of observation only.
recalling the question, it stated that buttons a,b,c exist which can be pressed by A, B and both simultaneously
whichever person runs out of button click first loses

Cleverly thinking, jo bhi pehle start karega, wo chahega that uski chance bhi legally valid move ho and at the same time, saamne wale ka loss bhi ho (since they are playing optimally)
and this the major deciding factor is c here....

So, agar person A starts first then he will surely click c first, until exhausted, thus, if c is even, A->B->A, then at the end of exhaustion of c buttons, A par chance wapis jayegi... and usko apne buttons hi utilise krna start krna padega, now game is b/w a and b, whichever is bada,  wins

Same goes for vice versa case, keeping in mind, kon pehle apne button use krna start karega nd who's having lesser ones
