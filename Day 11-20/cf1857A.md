A. Array Coloring

Took help from the channel itself,
Question asks if a given array can be colored in 2 colors such that the sum parity of each color element is same Or Not....(parity means, same nature of Even Odd here) and har color ka atleast ek element to hona hi chahiye

solution is pretty simple, anyhow agar overall odd numbers ka count is odd, i.e. parity of odd no's is odd, to kabhi Odd numbers ke num se even nhi ban skta,
elsewise, har case me same parity is somehow possible

Hence, parity checking wala concept is used here
