A. Desorting

Two operations can be performed any no. of times, 
choosing an index i, can +1 for all A[:i] and -1 from all A[i:]
Minimum steps required to make this sorted array UNSORTED

Took a little observation and pure intution looking at the testcases, 

Answer is, the smallest diff b/w any two elements in that sorted array, 
if the difference is d, operations reqd is  d/2+1

Visualisation be like : "difference d overcome krne ke liye, for each operation, 1st element +1 and other -1, thus diff decreases by 2... tbhi d/2 and +1 is bcz wo elements same na ho, 1st one bada ban jaaye, and other one chotaa"

And Done (P.S. solve karne ki kagar par tha, but took help :'))
