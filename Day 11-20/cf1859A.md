A. United We Stand

Could'nt figure it out on my own
Took help from the TLE channel itself

simple concept,
Given, an array A
if we want two different arrays, such that each element in array C should not be a divisor of any element in the other array B,
or for all elements [Bi]%[Ci]!=0
when we want this...
we can simply take the divisor as bigger number, hence,
(smaller)%(bigger)== smaller ( not 0 )
1Solution, 
Finding the max element in array A, adding it to other Array C, and rest of the elements to B

Done
