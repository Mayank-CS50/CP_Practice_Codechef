A. How Much Does Daytona Cost?

Simplest question till now
The problems simply asks if there Exists any non empty subsequence from the array such that the Integer given to us is present in majority

Now using the basic logic We can say that if an element Exists in that array then we can consider the subsequence as of length one Consisting only that element hence the Frequency of other elements must be zero and the frequency of a given element will be 1 therefore it will be present in majority always.

The only catch is the element should always be present in the array to be in majority

Therefore,
if Element in arr:
    Yes
else
    No
